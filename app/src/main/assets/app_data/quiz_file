UC	The evidence for his birth and existence as a human being is accepted by genuine historians and academics
UC	His birth into shame and poverty was predicted 750 years before – so was the nature and reason for his death
UC	He did not support dead religion but challenged hypocrisy wherever he saw it – the authorities hated him
UC	His teaching is still upheld as thoroughly logical and completely moral – neither mad nor bad
UC	Large numbers followed him and still do – his kindness, integrity and goodness are without match
UC	Due to his authority and actions, many believed him to be the long promised son of God
UC	His purpose and greatest claim was that he would connect people to God – He would be a gateway for them
UC	He claimed to bring freedom and fulfilment of IVP and SHM to everyone who took him at his word
UC	After a criminal’s death, his resurrection was reported by over 500 people. This included ‘doubting Thomas’, Peter the ‘denier’ and Saul his accuser. Even the Roman Officer who crucified him exclaimed, ‘Surely this man was the son of God!’ The authorities could not produce a dead body from the tomb to deny it!
UC	His promise is to remove the power of guilt and death for all who trust him for spiritual life and forgiveness

UC	“I gave in, and admitted that God was God”
UC	The person who follows Christ is truly connected to God – this is what fulfils their IVP (identity, value & purpose) and SHM (security, happiness & motivation)
UC	Humans’ rejection of God caused all the mess but Jesus came to put that right for all who accept him
UC	Jesus was human and divine so was uniquely able to take our punishment – he gave himself to cruel death
UC	Those who trust Him need no longer fear death, guilt or punishment – he took this on the cross
UC	Because he had never sinned, death could not hold him – his resurrection proved that
UC	When the spirit leaves a connected person, it goes to God and will be given a ‘resurrection body’ like
UC	Jesus To be connected is to be a true Christian – now living to enjoy God and to bring joy to him
